# Recursive Pyramids

This project demonstrates how to print left-aligned and right-aligned pyramids using **recursive functions** in C++.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid.
- Prints a **left-aligned pyramid** made of `#` characters.
- Prints a **right-aligned pyramid**, properly spaced.


## 📁 File

- `pyramids.cpp` – Contains the source code.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Recursion
- Loops
- String formatting
- Input/output in C++

### 🚀 How to Run

To compile and run the code using g++:

```bash
g++ pyramids.cpp -o pyramids
./pyramids
